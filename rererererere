# Functions with Python sample Foundry app

The Functions with Python sample Foundry app is a community-driven, open source project which serves as an example of an app which can be built using CrowdStrike's Foundry ecosystem. `foundry-sample-functions-python` is an open source project, not a CrowdStrike product. As such, it carries no formal support, expressed or implied.

This app is one of several App Templates included in Foundry that you can use to jumpstart your development. It comes complete with a set of preconfigured capabilities aligned to its business purpose. Deploy this app from the Templates page with a single click in the Foundry UI, create an app from this template using the Foundry CLI, or download it as a zip and import it.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To view documentation and deploy this sample app, you need access to the Falcon console.

## Description

The Functions with Python sample Foundry app shows how to use Python functions with FalconPy, workflows, API integrations, collections, and UI extensions. 

## Prerequisites

* The Foundry CLI (instructions below).
* Python 3.13+ (needed if running the app's functions locally). See [Python For Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) for installation instructions.

### Install the Foundry CLI

You can install the Foundry CLI with Scoop on Windows or Homebrew on Linux/macOS.

**Windows**:

Install [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/). Then, add the Foundry CLI bucket and install the Foundry CLI.

```shell
scoop bucket add foundry https://github.com/crowdstrike/scoop-foundry-cli.git
scoop install foundry
```

Or, you can download the [latest Windows zip file](https://assets.foundry.crowdstrike.com/cli/latest/foundry_Windows_x86_64.zip), expand it, and add the install directory to your PATH environment variable.

**Linux and macOS**:

Install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). Then, add the Foundry CLI repository to the list of formulae that Homebrew uses and install the CLI:

```shell
brew tap crowdstrike/foundry-cli
brew install crowdstrike/foundry-cli/foundry
```

Run `foundry version` to verify it's installed correctly.

## Getting Started

Clone this sample to your local system, or [download as a zip file](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/foundry-sample-functions-python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and import it into Foundry.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CrowdStrike/foundry-sample-functions-python
cd foundry-sample-functions-python
```

Log in to Foundry:

```shell
foundry login
```

Select the following permissions:

- [ ] Create and run RTR scripts
- [x] Create, execute and test workflow templates
- [x] Create, run and view API integrations
- [ ] Create, edit, delete, and list queries

Deploy the app:

```shell
foundry apps deploy
```

> [!TIP]
> If you get an error that the name already exists, change the name to something unique to your CID in `manifest.yml`.

Once the deployment has finished, you can release the app:

```shell
foundry apps release
```

Next, go to **Foundry** > **App catalog**, find your app, and install it. Go to **Fusion SOAR** > **Workflows** to see the test workflows from this app.

## About this sample app

<!-- Intro below should match app_docs/README.md -->

This sample is designed to show how to use Python Functions in Falcon Foundry. It contains a few capabilities:

1. Python functions:

   - [**hello**](functions/hello/main.py): Simple greeting service
   - [**host-details**](functions/host-details/main.py): Uses FalconPy to get Host details
   - [**servicenow**](functions/servicenow/main.py): Uses FalconPy to invoke an API Integration
   - [**log-event**](functions/log-event/main.py): Uses FalconPy to store data in a collection

2. Test workflows to invoke each function.
3. A UI extension on **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint detections** that can be used to call the `hello` function.

See this sample's [App docs README](app_docs/README.md) for configuration and usage information.

## Technical Implementation

- Built on CrowdStrike's Foundry Function framework
- Written in Python with dependencies including:
    - [crowdstrike-foundry-function](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/foundry-fn-python) and [FalconPy](https://falconpy.io/) for CrowdStrike API integration
